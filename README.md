(Group Project)
Here is a short summary of the project:

Our objective is to create a CNN model that can accurately classify each digit on the plate and classify which of the states of the UAE does the plate belong to.

We perform image pre-processing (Contouring) to extract images of individual digits on a plate.

(In this project, we apply the concept of transfer learning by obtaining the license plate number of each car plate by passing the car plate images to a pre-trained model.)
